# Fake-News-detection
This project is about fake news detection which includes prediction of a news article whether its real or not.
Firstly,what is fake news? Fake news is the wrong informationn provided by the media which leads to breakage of social bonds or causing outrage among people or may lead people wrong sometimes.So, it is necessary for one to differentiate what is wrong and what is right.This leads to necessity of Fake news detection system.
For building the fake news system,it only requires a few steps including:
1.Importing libraries
2.Reading and analyzing the data
3.Data preprocessing
4.Splitting the data into train and test data
5.Model traing 
6.Prediction and evaluation
As data is in textual format instead of numbers,we need to convert it into machine understandable format which is,of course,numbers,so for data preprocessing I used count vectorizer and tf-idf vectorizer.
And machine learning models used to train and test the data are Multinomial naive Bayes classifier and Passive Aggressive classifier.
